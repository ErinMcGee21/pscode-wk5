// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for ni
divide num by 2  (n1%2)
If remainder = 0
print even
ELSE IF remainder is not equal to 0
print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) enter 5 numbers
read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5

b) calculate average (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
print average

c) small = n1
large = n1
for i = n2 to n5
if n1 < ni then: ni = small
print small
if n1 > ni then: ni = large
print large


d) print average (average of all 5 numbers)

print small (smallest number of all 5 numbers)
print large (largest number of all 5 number)
